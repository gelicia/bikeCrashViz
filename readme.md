Visualizations to the bike data located at https://github.com/anton612/bicycledata go here.

The various files show my explorations as I went on.

I started with non aggregated data with Google Maps - see nonagg-googleMaps.html

I moved on to aggregated data with Google Maps - agg-googleMaps.html

I wanted to do click/mouseover events which googleMaps can't do the way I want, so I moved to leaflet.

index.html is data aggregated with leaflet, and what I envision the final version to be like.
